## Description

This is a web app created using React, designed to provide a seamless user experience for managing transactions with Flatiron Bank. The app allows users to view a table of their recent bank transactions, add new transactions through a form, and delete existing ones. The search bar facilitates filtering transactions based on descriptions, while two buttons enable sorting by category or description. The user-friendly interface and responsive design ensure a smooth experience on various devices. Leveraging React's state and props, the app efficiently fetches data from a local JSON server. It showcases practical implementation of components, props, state, events, and data fetching, making it an excellent platform for learning and practicing these concepts in React development.
